# MonteCarlo PiCalculation
Using random points in a square with an inner circle to calculate Pi approximately (see Monte Carlo algorithm).

## Description
<p>
If you draw a circle inside a square, the diameter is equal to the square's height and width.

<p>
The fourfold ratio of the area of both shapes equals Pi.

## Parameter
The higher the number of iterations (= number of points in square) the more exact Pi is calculated.

The standard deviation is around 0.001.
